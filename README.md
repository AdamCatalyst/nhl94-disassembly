# nhl94-disassembly
 Attempt to reverse engineer the code of NHL94 using the NHL Hockey Source Code

 The NHL Hockey Source Code can be found here, along with information on how to compile it - https://github.com/Mhopkinsinc/NHLHockey

**NHL94 Genesis Disassembly**

This repo contains a disassembled IDA Pro database of the NHL'94 Genesis ROM.

The repo also has a LST file, allowing anyone with a text editor to view the disassembled code, and view the comments describing the code and the function names.
The src folder was made along with the LST file, and contains labels for RAM locations (unfortunately, it does not have the comments describing the specific RAM variables)

I will update this from time to time to keep it updated. The current goal of this project is to try to reverse engineer the code.

Please join the NHL'94 Discord to discuss this code - https://discord.gg/KXJeQ6pyUc
